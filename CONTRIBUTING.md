# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving the 2017 Educator Lessons repo.

## How to contribute

1. **Bug fixes or typos** — Open an issue or submit a pull request. One change per PR (e.g. one file or one lesson) keeps review simple.
2. **New examples or lessons** — Follow the existing structure: add files under the right `NN_GiveLesson` folder and update that folder’s [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) and the [main ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) if you add a new topic line.
3. **Naming** — Use underscores, no spaces in file/folder names. Prefer lowercase for filenames; keep `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `LICENSE` with exact casing.

## Where to start

- [Main roadmap](ROADMAP.md) — navigation hub for all lessons and reference.
- Per-lesson `ROADMAP.md` — lists topics and contents for that lesson.

If you’re unsure, open an issue and we can align on the approach.
